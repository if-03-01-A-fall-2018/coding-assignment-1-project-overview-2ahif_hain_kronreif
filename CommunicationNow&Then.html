    <h1>Communication</h1>
  <section>
    <p>the days of corresponding via telephone and letter writing were not that long ago,
      although in this virtual age such means appear all but antiquated.
      So, have the “good old days” of pen, ink and voice been outdated?
      Well, the answer to this is certainly a resounding “yes” in many cultures and business around the world.
      We now utilise high-speed Internet, fax, VoIP conference calling and the wonders of email.
      However, are these means truly that much different than the days when we used to scribe letters, </p>

        <h2>Then</h2>
        <p>For most of human history, in order to send a message to someone,
          you needed to physically deliver it. People used to communicate with the help of birds and animals.
           They used to send letters or messages by training there birds.
           But birds could only travel so far.
           In the 5th century BCE, Persian king Darius the Great built
           the Royal Road to improve communication throughout his large empire.</p>
