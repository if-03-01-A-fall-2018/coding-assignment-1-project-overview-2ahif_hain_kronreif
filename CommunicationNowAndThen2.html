      <h2>Now</h2>
      <p>One thing happening in today's current society is communication loss.<br>
        This generation breathes on technology, and without it, mankind will struggle to advance, <br>
        meaning they would potentially have to start back at square one. Despite that, <br>
        this statement takes a giant leap in many directions. With this new technology comes new abilities <br>
        and new things to handle, which can, of course, be a distraction from reality. <br>
        This generation, though, takes technology distraction to a whole new level. <br><br>
        Technology has an enormous impact on todayâ€™s society, everywhere you go, <br>
        there will be technology around. In schools, offices, stores, anywhere. <br>
        Though this may seem like a good thing, it actually has more hurting qualities then benefiting.<br></p>
