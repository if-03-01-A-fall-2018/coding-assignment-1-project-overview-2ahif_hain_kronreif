    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>the days of corresponding via telephone and letter writing were not that long ago,<br>
      although in this virtual age such means appear all but antiquated.<br>
      So, have the “good old days” of pen, ink and voice been outdated?<br>
      Well, the answer to this is certainly a resounding “yes” in many cultures and business around the world.<br>
      We now utilise high-speed Internet, fax, VoIP conference calling and the wonders of email.<br>
      However, are these means truly that much different than the days when we used to scribe letters, <br></p>

        <h2>Then</h2>
        <p>For most of human history, in order to send a message to someone,<br>
         you needed to physically deliver it. People used to communicate with the help of birds and animals.<br>
         They used to send letters or messages by training there birds.<br>
         But birds could only travel so far.<br>
         In the 5th century BCE, Persian king Darius the Great built<br>
         the Royal Road to improve communication throughout his large empire.<br><br>
         The first long-distance phone call was made by Alexander Graham Bell to his assistant,<br>
         Thomas Watson, on Aug. 10, 1876, from Brantford to Paris, Ontario.<br>
         Watson would also receive the first transcontinental phone call in 1915,<br>
         where Bell said the same thing he said in 1876.<br></p>
